# The front-end
## Explanation
The programming language for the front-end is Vue 3. I Chose to use Vue because it was recommended in allot of places. It is easier to learn the most other programming languages because there is a big community behind it, there are no regular updates so it wont change as much as others, it is intuitive and has great documentation.

## Design
I started out with making a design of what i roughly wanted it to look like.
